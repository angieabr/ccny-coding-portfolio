        "## Reflection - Activity 1\n",
        "I believe this reflection portion is many times more difficult than the coding itself, as I am unsure of what to write about. The process itself was quite straighforward, and I used various resources to check different ways of accomplishing the sames tasks. The introduction of f-strings was interesting, as I haven't heard of them before. I liked the addition of imputing a code that results in an error, as it's another way to explain how something works, by showing how it *can't* be done."
